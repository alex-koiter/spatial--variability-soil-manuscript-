abstract: |
  Quantification and accurate assessment of the spatial variability and distribution of soil physical and biogeochemical properties (fingerprints) are vital components of agri-environmental research and modeling, including sediment source fingerprinting. Understanding the distribution of soil properties at a range of spatial scales is crucial in the development of appropriate, reliable, and efficient sampling campaigns. This study was aimed to investigate the spatial variability in soil geochemical and colour (i.e., spectral reflectance) fingerprints across two contrasting land uses. The main objectives of this study are to: 1) quantify the spatial variability of geochemical and colour fingerprint properties at a field-scale (~ 40 ha) across agricultural and forested sites; 2) evaluate the spatial variability and distribution of soil fingerprint properties and its relation to a range of terrain attributes (e.g., slope); and 3) identify the possible sources of variation in each land use, primarily environmental factors. A combination of univariate analysis and geostatistical methods were applied to analyze the soil geochemistry and colour properties. This information was used to both quantify and assess the variability in commonly used fingerprints. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation model (DEM) were used to investigate spatial variation of soil geochemical and colour fingerprint properties. The ability of terrain attributes to explain the observed variability in soil fingerprints played an important role across all properties. The present study suggest that kriging interpolation can directly reveal the spatial distribution of soil fingerprint properties and quantify the variability at a field-scale.

  Spatial analysis is tricky buisness
key-points:
  - Most soil colour and geochemical properties demonstrated little spatial autocorrelation
  - Soil properties that did demonstrate were best predicted by elevation, wetness, and slope position
