Understanding the distribution of soil properties at a range of spatial scales is crucial in the development of appropriate, reliable, and efficient sampling campaigns. This study was aimed to investigate the spatial variability in soil geochemical and colour (i.e., spectral reflectance) fingerprints across two contrasting land uses. The main objectives of this study are to: 1) quantify the spatial variability of geochemical and colour fingerprint properties at a field-scale (~ 40 ha) across agricultural and forested sites; 2) evaluate the spatial variability and distribution of soil fingerprint properties and its relation to a range of terrain attributes (e.g., slope); and 3) identify the possible sources of variation in each land use, primarily environmental factors. A combination of univariate analysis and geostatistical methods were applied to analyze the soil geochemistry and colour properties. This information was used to both quantify and assess the variability in commonly used fingerprints. It was found that the importance of the sampling approach (spatial scale) varied with respect to both the fingerprint properties and land uses. Geostatistical analysis demonstrated that only seven geochemical and seven colour fingerprint properties exhibited a strong spatial pattern. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation model (DEM) were used to investigate spatial variation of soil geochemical and colour fingerprint properties. The ability of terrain attributes to explain the observed variability in soil fingerprints played an important role across all properties. The present study suggest that kriging interpolation can directly reveal the spatial distribution of soil fingerprint properties and quantify the variability at a field-scale.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Spatial analysis is tricky buisness\nkey-points:\n  - Most soil colour and geochemical properties demonstrated little spatial autocorrelation\n  - Soil properties that did demonstrate were best predicted by elevation, wetness, and slope position\ndate-modified: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: geoderma.csl\ncitation:\n  container-title: Geoderma\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\neruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)\nn_eruptions <- length(eruptions)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeline .cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npar(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)\nplot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), \n  pch = \"|\", axes = FALSE)\naxis(1)\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](index_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-1.png){#fig-timeline fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\navg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout .hidden}\n\n```\n[1] 79.83333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average.\n\nStudies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\n\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                 | Year   |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| Current              | 2021   |\n| Teneguía             | 1971   |\n| Nambroque            | 1949   |\n| El Charco            | 1712   |\n| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677   |\n| Volcán San Martin    | 1646   |\n| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |\n| Montaña Quemada      | 1492   |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\nLa Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::",
